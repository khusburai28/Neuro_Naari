Women are becoming increasingly involved in various aspects of the tech world, from programming to leading companies. The WomenTech Network is one of the driving forces behind this surge, inspiring and empowering women to make a significant impact in the tech industry.\n\nDespite the tech industry being predominantly male-dominated, women are steadily making their presence felt. According to the World Economic Forum, women make up only 28% of the total workforce in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This growing movement is not just limited to the United States or Europe but is making waves worldwide.\n\nIn regions like Africa, Asia, and Latin America, women are launching companies, developing apps, and making a difference in their communities. For example, in Africa, women now represent 28% of the tech workforce, a significant increase from previous years. Similarly, in India, the percentage of women in the IT sector has risen to 34%, up from 21% in 2015.\n\nIt is essential to continue supporting this movement and fostering an inclusive environment to ensure the ongoing growth and success of women in tech. Explore additional resources and **[women in tech statistics](https://www.womentech.net/women-technology-statistics)** and gain a deeper understanding of the progress and challenges in this area.\n\n[![women in tech events](https://www.womentech.net/sites/default/files/glazed-cms-media/women_in_tech_network.jpg?fid=55089)](https://www.womentech.net/events)\n\nOne of the most important things to note about this trend is that it is not just happening in the United States or Europe. Women in tech are making a global impact. In Africa, Asia, and Latin America, women are starting companies, coding apps, and making a difference in their communities. This is an important movement to watch and support because it is changing the landscape of the tech industry.\n\n## Women in Tech - Reasons for the Trend\n\nSo, why are women becoming more involved in the tech industry? There are many reasons for this trend. First of all, Women in Tech are becoming more visible. In the past, women in tech were often hidden behind the scenes, but now they are coming to the forefront and being recognized for their talents, for example at the **[Women in Tech Awards](https://www.womentech.net/en-us/women-tech-awards)**¬†or the **[Women in Tech Conference](https://www.womentech.net/women-tech-conference)**. Also in part, with the rise of **[social media](https://www.linkedin.com/company/womentech-network/)**, women have a platform to share their stories and connect with other like-minded individuals.\n\nSecondly, the tech industry is becoming more accessible to women. In the past, it was difficult for women to break into the tech industry. But now, there are more resources available to help women succeed in tech. There are more **[women in tech events](https://www.womentech.net/women-in-tech-events)**, women in tech conferences,¬†**[women-led startups and accelerators](https://www.womentech.net/blog/21-accelerators-incubators-programs-and-more-female-founders)**, and there are more **[career mentoring programs](https://www.womentech.net/women-tech-career-mentoring-program)** to support women in tech.\n\nLastly, the demand for women in tech is increasing. We live in a world that is increasingly reliant on technology, and companies are starting to realize that they need diversity in their workforce to be successful. Women bring a unique perspective to the table, and they are in high demand.\n\n## Women in Tech - Making a Difference\n\nWomen in tech are not only changing the face of technology, they are also making a difference in the world. Women in tech are using their skills to solve problems and make a positive impact on the world. Here are just a few examples:\n\n- Women in the United States are leading the way in the field of robotics. One example is Dr. Ayanna Howard, who is the founder and Chief Technology Officer of Zyrobotics. She is the first woman to hold the role Dean of Engineering at The Ohio State University College of Engineering.\n- Women in China are using technology to improve healthcare for rural women and children. For example, the founder of a Maternal Health Care Information System provides healthcare information to rural mothers in China.\n- Women in India are using technology to fight gender discrimination. For example, Arushi Mittal¬†the Co-founder of People for Parity, which uses technology to help women file complaints about gender discrimination.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the ways that women in tech are making a difference. Women all over the world are using their skills to make a positive impact, and this is only the beginning.¬† In the next section, we will look at some inspiring examples of women who have made a difference in the tech world.\n\n## Women in Tech - Inspiring Examples in Recent Years\n\nNumerous inspiring examples of women have made a significant impact in the tech world in recent years. Let's take a look at a few trailblazers who have left their mark:\n\n- Marissa Mayer: As the CEO of Yahoo! from 2012 to 2017, Marissa Mayer stands as one of the most successful women in tech in recent years.
